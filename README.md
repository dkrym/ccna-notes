# ccna-notes
Notes from CBT Nuggets CCNA video course taken during my prep for Cisco CCNA 200-301 in 2020.

Taken in note taking program CherryTree 0.39.3 (cbt file) and exported to PDF.

Disclaimer:
The notes itself are not learning material and will not prepare you for the exam. I watched entire course and took these notes so I could read them before taking the exam. If you are using my notes, be aware they were made for myself and I had already networking fundamentals so some chapters are empty or with very few notes as I didn't even intend cover everything.
